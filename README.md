# GoogleBasicWebpage
A basic introduction into the google scripts usage with a web interface 

The intention of this repository is to help beginer programmers who are interested into the google scripts gain the basic knowledge 
to get started. I choose to do this after the sample google scripts was still a little too complicated for me, so I broke everything
down to the basics. 

What this program actually accomplishes is the totalling of the number of files on the server side and relay that to the user. In 
future iterations, I plan to have the client be the one that is quiered and thier files are totalled. For this to happen it would 
require a permission request from the user, which may not be ideal.
